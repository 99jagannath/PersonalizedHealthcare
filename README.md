# PersonalizedHealthcare

The healthcare industry produces a large amount of raw health-care data daily that can be used to extract information for predicting disease that can happen to a patient in future while using the treatment history and health data. These data will be later used for effective decision making for patient’s health. This area has a very high scope of improvements by using informative data in healthcare. 
The importance of effective personalized patient treatment system where predictions based on a patient’s treatment history and health data can be used for personalized treatment; for recommending the doctors and medicines etc is missing in the current healthcare sector. Additionally, the risks of some patients being re-admitted in the hospital are often problematic as expenses tend to increase. The expected cost for the patient in the next X years, predicting emergency department visits will affect their livelihood; therefore, he should be aware of the insurance policies best suited for them.
